# Bolus-Calculator
This application simulates an insulin pump bolus interface. It calculates a bolus given a certain number of carbohydrates and the user's blood glucose level. Upper and lower target blood glucose thresholds are included, along with carbs per unit. I decided to create this project after my insulin pump broke in February 2020 and I couldn't find an efficient way to calculate boluses.
